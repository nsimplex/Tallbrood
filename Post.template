Tallbrood adds a lifecycle to Tallbirds. Nestless Tallbirds create new nests and eggs inside them hatch into Smallbirds, which follow their parent until fully grown (at which point they will make their own nests).

Tallbrood is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2. The code is hosted at [URL="https://github.com/nsimplex/tallbrood"]GitHub[/URL].

[B]Description[/B]:
[SPOILER]
[LIST]
[*] Tallbirds without a nest will make a new one after one week. Nests will only be made on rocky or dirt (turfless) ground.
[*] A Tallbird will hatch the egg in its nest, which will grow into a Smallbird in 6 days. The hatched Smallbird will follow its parent throughout its growth into a Teenbird and finally into a Tallbird, which will then proceed to make its own nest.
